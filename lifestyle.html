My current dietetary setup.

I am a climber weighting ~74-76kg. I've experimented with dozens of dietetary techniques and theories for last few years.
Went from 90kg to 72kg by just climbing and not eating sweets, but it was a constant struggle and controlling my diet took a lot of my attention.
Tried to only eat stuff <300kcal/100g, only <400kcal/100g (remember: carbs and proteins ~4kcal/g, fat 9gkcal/g! also: fat takes a lot of time to kick in!).
Tried most of the ideas from 4h body by Tim Ferris.
Tried to eat a lot of whey protein with skyr yogurt. 

But finally I went to a dietician and she told me to simply get a catering service.
I pay 60PLN/day (16usd) for 5 meals delivered each morning, balanced diet with slightly elevated proteins, 2500kcal (0.5kg reduction / week, I will move to 2800kcal or 3000kcal at some point).
Bought the cheapest 230PLN (62usd) microwave (sometimes I will also use an oven, but it's not really required). 
Now I have to stick to a single rule: only eat stuff from catering (and maybe have a cheat day when visiting my parents or wanting to cook with smb).

This is so much simpler to follow, feels healthier and controlled.
I've been only doing this for past few weeks, so we'll see, but it might be THE solution.
The downside is the plastic waste production, but at least I scrupulously segregate my waste and never buy bottled liquids.
It will also take a few weeks to see if it causes or prevents gastric problems. 
I still have to test it on mountain hiking and climbing trips - is the packaging handy enough for eating outdoor?

PS. When it comes to liquids: I only drink water, coffee, mint and tea.
I think there is zero point in drinking stuff that tastes sweet. 
It won't give the feeling of eating stuff while it will either deliver a lot of calories or deregulate you (insulin spikes etc).
