The -u option in cp often help when you are to lazy to use rsync, but copying takes too long and also was interupted, here is what it does:
'copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing'
I often endup using:
cp -vru old_dir/ new_dir/

Checking the size and other info about an image in shell:
identify color.jpg
Will require some version of imagemagick, I just did 'apt-get install' the first proposed one.

PIL->OpenCV conversion:

from PIL import Image
img = PIL.Image.open('img.jpg').convert('RGB') 
img = numpy.array(img) 
img = img[:, :, ::-1].copy() #RGB to BGR 

Width height order:
height, width = image.shape[:2] #cv2
width, height = image.size[:2] #PIL

Reading width and height without loading the whole image to memory - just open with PIL and don't display/modify:
image = Image.open(path)

****************************************

Replace first char in each line inplace in all .txt files in directory:
sed -i 's/^./new_string/g' *.txt
Use carefully! I've damaged some datasets by mistake with it.

Delete all empty txt files:
find . -name '*.txt' -size 0 -delete

Less with line numbering (-N) and starting from line (+n):
less +29300 -N my_very_long_file_with_stupid_newline_missing_in_the_middle_of_it.txt

Quick partial ls of very big folder (-U suppresses sorting):
ls -U | head -40

Shuffle lines in a text file:
sort -R file.txt > out.txt
In fact is sorts by hashes, so it's semi-random and stable.

Solution to "Argument list too long" error while trying to mv or cp a lot of files in bash:
instead of mv * target_dir/
ls | xargs mv -t target_dir/

Replace in file syntax:
sed -i 's/old_dir/new_dir\/subdir_after_escaping_slash/' test.txt
Delete all lines containing string 'my_text' inline:
sed -i '/my_text/d' filename.txt 
Prepend dir name to each line (replace ^ which is beginning of a line):
sed -i.bak 's/^/dir_name\//' infile.txt
-i.bak flag makes sed work inplace, but creates backup file with .bak extension.

Quitting hanging ssh session:
ctrl + d, if it doesn't work:
enter ~ .

Jupyter: stopping execution programmatically:
class StopExecution(Exception):
    def _render_traceback_(self):
        pass
# ....
raise StopExecution

Darknet/YOLO_v4 - tips:
It's surprisingly hard to find the actual architecture of YOLO models; and there is no Tensorboard to browse through the computation graph.
It appears that https://netron.app/ and https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron support Darknet's .cfg files and return beautiful, interactive graphs.
These graphs help to understand how the 3 [yolo] layers (2 for tiny-yolo) are attached (deep supervision of the model).

Problems:
1) The relation between batch/minibatch/subdivision/epoch/iteration/darknet binary outputs/steps/brun_in values/XXXX.weights is counterintuitive to me. 
Asked questions on stack overflow, run some experiments; waiting for results.
2) I would greatly appreciate if darknet returned current learning rate alongside with other metrics - perhaps I will fork and rebuild it.
3) I still don't understand anchors/mask parameters per [yolo] layer instance. Why only a small portion of anchors is used at all?

My struggle to a find short but accurate description of the YOLO object detection network:

First, we had sliding windows + classification.
Then R-CNN use unsupervised method (selective search) to propose bounding boxes.
Fast R-CNN proposed bounding boxes after features extraction with the backbone network.
Faster R-CNN learned a separate neural network to learn region proposals. The classification network also predicted offsets for BBs.
YOLO introduced grid, and for each grid cell m bounding boxes (aka. anchors) are generated. One network predicts class, offset, width/height adjustment.

Setting DNS records is always painful - tiny details matter, tutorials are often wrong, changes take undefined time to propagate.
Github pages + GoDaddy:
First had to disable redirection (which was hidden deep). Than set:
a 	@ 	185.199.108.153
a 	@ 	185.199.109.153
a 	@ 	185.199.110.153
a 	@ 	185.199.111.153
cname 	www 	@
cname 	www.drapej.com 	@

A records MUST have '@' as 'name'.
_domainconnect can be deleted or kept - doesn't matter
TTS - kept default values.

The repo has to be named huxwell.github.io, (huxwell = my username), Settings->Custom Domain name MUST be www.drapej.com not drapej.com. 
CNAME file in repo root: www.drapej.com (NOT drapej.com)

Git deleting branches:
git push origin --delete branch_name
git branch -D branch_name

Jupyter logging model training with Darknet (%%capture will suppress live output, so it's not an option):
import datetime
file_prefix = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S")
!./darknet detector params 2>&1 | tee ../train_logs/{file_prefix}.txt

Neural Networks/ML in general:
How to label border cases?
Is 15% of a cat's tail a cat?
Is very blurred image of cat a cat?
Should we use soft targets for neural networks?
(0.8 0.2) (cat, not cat) ?
Is such regression easier or harder to learn?

Asked a question on ai.stackexchange: 
https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/26175/how-to-treat-label-and-process-edge-case-inputs-in-machine-learning
Received some long replies, but didn't learn anything new from them :(
I need to find some papers that directly compare different approaches in quantitative way.

AWS EC2:
If you stop VMs when you don't use them and then restart, the address will change each time which is super annoying with ssh.
Go to console.aws.amazon.com -> type Elastic IPs in search -> choose ec2 feature (not VPC feature) -> Allocate Elastic IP address (use all default options)
Checkbox newly created IP -> Actions -> Associate Elastic IP -> choose your instance from the list. 
Now you can always scp/sftp/ssh to newly created ip instead of always changing ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-2.amazonaws.com .
According to aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/ it costs around 12 cents / day if the instance is stopped AFAIU.

****************************************
AWS EC2:
Extend disc space (EBS):
Instances: checkbox target VM, Storage, click volume id, actions, modify volume. 
SSH to machine, df -hT, lsblk to get more info.
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1 (counterintuitive, because lsblk and aws docs suggest 'xvda1 1')
Should be enough, but df and lsbik show  different values, so I also used:
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

No reboot required!

Jupyter shortcuts: Esc to leve editing mode, arrows to jump between cells
DD - delete cell
L - show line numbers
Enter - back to editing
H - show shortcuts help

Run persistently (more reliable than nohup to me):
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8080 &> /dev/null & disown
Connect with forwarding:
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 some_short_alias

****************************************
Github pages: often an old versions of the files are being served. 
https://github.com/user/repo/deployments
( https://github.com/huxwell/huxwell.github.io/deployments for me ) is a way to check if your commits have already been deployed.

2 Feb 2021
****************************************
With ssh (especially for Amazon EC2) it's very usefull to do alias in ~/.ssh/config, i.e:

Host some_short_alias
  HostName ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-2.amazonaws.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/some_key_path.pem
  User my_username
  
And than always do ssh a_short_name instead of ssh -i "~/.ssh/some_key_path.pem" ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-2.amazonaws.com
Also, Visual Studio Code adds a record there automatically when you use Remote Explorer-> SSH Targets-> +
Open files explorer and type sftp://a_short_name to user gui ftp file explorer.
Rsync commands sometimes get very messy, so this alias helps a bit:
rsync -av --dry-run /home/local_user/dir/ a_short_name:remote_dir_name
